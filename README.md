# Api-Exercise
Node v16.14.2

Challenges:
Multiple requests had to be done to the decryption api and finding a way to wait for all the requests to finish was challenging.
Handling the case where the api was not available was challenging.

Improvements:
All tasks were done in sequence one after the other.
Doing the sequence in batches may improve the performance.
Running requests parallelly is another option to be explored.
